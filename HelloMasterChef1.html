        <h2>Preparation Method</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Flour: I use all-purpose flour for these pancakes, but whole wheat, spelt, or even your favorite gluten-free flour blend will work in this recipe (or see my gluten free buckwheat pancakes). I often use a 50:50 blend of whole wheat and all-purpose flour and love them. See my whole wheat pancakes for more tips.</li>
        <li>Sugar: I don’t like really sweet pancakes, so we add just enough sugar to the batter to ensure they taste great, but we don’t go overboard.</li>
        <li>Baking powder: Keeps our pancakes light and fluffy. Use recently purchased double-acting baking powder (it lasts about 3 months). If you are sensitive to the flavor of baking powder, make sure that yours is aluminum-free. If you only have baking soda, check the tips below the recipe for a substitution.</li>
        <li>Milk or non-dairy milk: Both work for this recipe, so use what you have. I’ve successfully made dairy-free pancakes with oat milk, almond milk, and coconut milk (carton, not canned).</li>
        <li>Egg: Adds structure and flavor, but you can make these pancakes without eggs (use a flax egg or see this vegan pancake recipe instead).</li>
        <li>Butter: You can’t beat the taste of butter when making pancakes. Use unsalted or salted butter. For salted butter, omit the salt in our pancake recipe.</li>
        <li>Vanilla: Adds a soft, sweet flavor. I always add a splash of vanilla to pancake batter (even when someone tells me not to).</li>
